The resamplers in this directory are suitable to compensate drifts
caused by connected soundcards:

Given that a buffersize of N samples is received, the resamplers output 
N + EPS samples. EPS may in this case be positive and negative and arbitrary.

Also, the value of EPS may change from one frame to the next.

How does it work? The following is done

1) Upsampling by a specific factor (e.g. Nup = 8)
2) Interpolation: We may use FIR and IIR interpolation. If FIR is used, we exploit 
a polyphase implementation to reduce complexity. If IIR is used, a polyphase realization seemed to
be too complex in terms of development effort and - if once designed - not flexible enough.
3) Lagrange interpolation


====================================================================================

In this directory, three variants of resamplers are available:

Variant I:
FIR filter in polyphase structure I. We generate a buffer of audio samples in the upsampled domain
and afterwards do the Lagrange interpolation.

Variant II:
FIR Filter in polyphase structure II. We do everything in parallel: Produce the output samples from the
interpolation filter only at time indices we really need for Lagrange interpolation.

Variant III:
IIR filter. We generate a buffer of audio samples in the upsampled domain and afterwards do the Lagrange 
interpolation (same as variant I but with IIR filter which is not polyphase).
