How we may improve the Voice transformer":

1) For low pitch frequencies, the energy is very much focused onto rare pulses. This leads to
high peak values in the output signal which may therefore saturate.
The solution would be
a) to add an allpass filter to destroy the peakness of the peaks.
b) to use other than pulse excitations for very low pitch frequencies. E.g., we may use a square function to replace the pulses.
2) The noise excitation may well be pitch filtered
3) The pitch may be fractional (at the moment it is integer).
