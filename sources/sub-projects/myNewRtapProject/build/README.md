This directory contains only temporary platform-specific files.

All files are automatically generated. NEVER MANUALLY EDIT THESE FILES! Do not change project settings using Visual Studio. Your changes will be automatically overwritten. All files can safely be deleted and re-generated by running the file ../configure.bat or ../configure.sh. 

If you generated this directory for use with Visual Studio, you can open the file Project.sln in Visual Studio to work with the project.
